# Stock Market Prediction Algorithm 
## Project Idea:
Stock price prediction using LSTM implemented in keras with TF backend on daily closing price of Apple data from Jan 2012 to December 2019 in order to predict the future prices
Note: the model is in no way fit for real life monetary purposes, it is simply an excuse to try out using LSTM models

## Data Used:

## Result: 
Root Mean Squared Error: 5.25
